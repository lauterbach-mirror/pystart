Welcome to lauterbach pystart's documentation!
==============================================

Lauterbach TRACE32 is an environment for embedded debugging. For starting it you need a configuration file in a custom
format. With :py:mod:`lauterbach.trace32.pystart` we want to create a simplified and flexible way to generate such
configuration files and start TRACE32 PowerView instances from Python.
